## Palette Test
Palette Test is a tool that allows designers to view color palettes in a series of tests that show how the colors interact with each other.

### Setup
Palette test is compiled using metalsmith, so you'll need the latest stable version
of node and npm.

If you don't have npm installed already, I highly recommend managing node versions
with nvm - node version manager.

1. `$ brew install nvm` will give you NVM

2. `$ nvm install stable` will install latest npm version.

3. `$ npm install` will install dependencies listed in package.json.
