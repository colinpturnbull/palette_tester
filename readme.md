## Palette Test
Palette Test is a tool that allows designers to view color palettes in a series of tests that show how the colors interact with each other.

### Setup
Palette test is compiled using metalsmith, so you'll need the latest stable version
of node and npm.

1. `$ brew install nvm`

2. `$ nvm install stable`
